# Homework 1: Intro to Swift and Xcode 
#### Due: Wednesday, September 16


###Description
This will be a light introductory homework assignment to get your fingers warmed up with Swift 2.0 and Xcode 7. We will be exploring this new environment by fixing some bugs in the debugging.playground file.

###Setting Up
Fork this repository and open the debugging.playground file with Xcode 7. You will then be able to make changes locally, and make commits/pushes to your fork.
Also, please refer to piazza if you are having trouble setting up Xcode 7. 

###Notes
Take a look at the compilers suggestions, error messages, and warning. The playground gives very useful information that can make debugging easy. It is also a great place to test out the effects of certain lines of code, without having to create new projects or files.

###Submitting
We will provide a google form for you to link your fork, with your submission. This will be done either during the beginning of the lecture as part of sign in, or we will post a google form on Piazza.
