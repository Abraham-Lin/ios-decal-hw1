# Homework 1: Intro to Swift and Xcode 
#### Due: Wednesday, September 16


###Description
This will be a light introductory homework assignment to get your fingers warmed up with Swift 2.0 and Xcode 7. We will be exploring this new environment by fixing some bugs in the debugging.playground file.

###Setting Up
Simply clone this repository and open the debugging.playground file with Xcode 7. Please refer to piazza if you are having trouble setting up Xcode 7.

###Notes
Take a look at the compilers suggestions, error messages, and warning. The playground gives very useful information that can make debugging easy. It is also a great place to test out the effects of certain lines of code, without having to create new projects or files.

###Submitting
Submission details are still being finalized. This will change with updated instructions on how to submit.
